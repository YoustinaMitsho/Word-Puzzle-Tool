# 🧩 EzyGamer - Word To Puzzle Generator!

Welcome, Game Master! 🎮

Word To Puzzle Generator is a Unity tool designed to dynamically generate engaging **Single or Multi-Word Puzzles**. This project was built to provide a versatile and interactive experience for players by integrating animations, word selections, and progressive challenges. 🏆

## 🎯 Project Overview

Word To Puzzle Generator allows players to interact with a puzzle system where they must **select the correct word** to progress through the game. A correct choice advances them to the next level, while an incorrect choice triggers an alternate animation that reflects the consequence of their decision. 😱

## 🛠️ Features

✅ **Dynamic Level Generation** – Levels are automatically generated based on configurable images, words, and correct answers. 📜

✅ **Immersive Animations** – Scenarios come to life with engaging visuals that react to player choices. 🎬

✅ **Intuitive Click-Based Mechanics** – Players select one option out of many, testing their logic and problem-solving skills. 🖱️

✅ **Modular & Reusable** – Built to seamlessly integrate into any Unity-based game! 🔄

✅ **Developer-Friendly** – Clean code structure following SOLID principles, event-driven patterns, and properly documented for ease of use. 💻

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Set Up the Challenge** – Each level loads an animation depicting a problem scenario.
2. **Choose Wisely** – Players pick the correct words to solve the puzzle.
3. **See the Outcome** – The animation changes dynamically based on the player's choice.
4. **Progress or Perish** – A correct answer moves to the next level, while a wrong choice leads to a consequence animation. 🔥

📜 **Initial Documentation**

As part of the development process, an initial draft was created outlining how the game would be coded. This document reflects the original vision for the project. However, due to time constraints and gaps in knowledge on certain topics, not all intended features could be fully implemented. Despite this, working on this project has been an incredible learning experience, and I have gained valuable insights into game level generating. I look forward to receiving feedback and reviews to further improve my skills! 🚀

👾 **Game on, Developer!** This project showcases the power of interactive puzzle design.
